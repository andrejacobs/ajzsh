ajzsh - Z Shell setup for Andre Jacobs
======================================

This directory contains shell scripts and resources to configure the zsh environment just the way I like it.

This is based on the work of https://github.com/spicycode/ze-best-zsh-config

Directories
-----------

./
	Contains all the scripts that configure Z shell.
	
extras
	Custom configuration for my machine and overrides.

templates
	At the moment only zshrc.ajzsh exists and is used during the installation process.

utils
	Scripts that provide various utility functions and are not loaded by default.
